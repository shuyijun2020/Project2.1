          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Happiness and Humand Development Index</h2>
          <p>Happiness is a life goal for humanity. It's not about a short-lifed laughing loud or excitment from winning a lottory or 
            even getting a promotion. It is a genuine feeling of truly satisfied or content with what you have. Happy people enjoying 
            life and are willing to spread the happiness to others. .. Happy people live longer. Happy people have better relationships.
            In the society today, all governments are working hard to improve the happiness.  United Nations Development Programme
            developed Human Development Index(HDI) with parameters of life expectance index, education index and gross national income
            per capita. Can this be an indicator as happiness? On the other hand, a common perception is that happy people tend to 
            consume more alcolhol. Some thought that beer and wine can be good indicators or contributors to happiness. Is happiness 
            correlated to alcolhol consumptions? </p>

          <p>In this project, we evaluated the correlations of HappinessScores with the following variables: Human Development Index, GDP, 
            Spirit_PerCapita, Beer_PerCapita, and Wine_PerCapita.  The data is from 123 countries, and an interactive scatter plot is 
            presented to visualize the correlations.</p>

          <p>The results indicate that only the Human Development Index(HDI) is positively correlated to HappinessScores. GDP is also 
            positively correlated to HappinessScore. Alcolhol consumption, regardless Spirit_PerCapita, Beer_PerCapita, or Wine_PerCapita, 
            has no correlation with HappinessScores. Drinking will certainly not make one happier.
